## Identifying deleterious mutations in SSD1 sequence
The next step of this analysis is run PROVEAN to detect possible deleterious mutations in the ssd1 gene sequence of each strain. To do that, I need to identify all missense mutations in the amino acid sequence of SSD1.

### Step 1. Convert aligned DNA sequence to amino acid using EMBOSS
```
transeq  -sequence SSD1.alg.rc.fa - outseq SSD1.prot
```

### Step 2. Detect point mutations in the amino acid sequence using a modified version of unique.pl
